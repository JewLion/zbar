ZBAR BAR CODE READER FOR MARMALADE
==================================
ZBar, adapated to Marmalade build system by Braden MacDonald

Only supports QR code functionality


HOW TO BUILD
============
If you need both x86 and ARM builds, use "zbar.mkb" to build the libraries.
This uses modified source code designed to compile with both the Visual Studio
compiler and GCC.
Be sure to compile for each target you will be using for your project,
e.g. x86 Release, x86 debug, ARM Release, and ARM Debug.

If you only need ARM builds, replace "zbar.mkb" with "zbar-arm-only.mkb",
then double-click the new "zbar.mkb" file to open the project in Visual Studio,
then select each ARM (GCC) build and press F7 to build each one (Debug and 
Release). This will use the unmodified original zbar source code.

Then:

HOW TO USE
==========

Add the following to the MKB file for your project:

	options 
	{
		#Adjust path as necessary:
		module_path="../zbar-marmalade" 
	}

	subprojects
	{
		zbar
	}

Then, in your project source files, simply add
	#include "zbar.h"
and use zbar according to the API documentation.
Note that only the C API will be available, not the C++ API.

Example of use: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/zbar/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Scan_images_using_the_API#C

I've tested the ARM build and it works very well for reading QR codes.
